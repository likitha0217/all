(<small>Taken from [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and edited in a few places to suit this theme.</small>)

This cheatsheet shows you the markdown that is supported when using Mdx with Gatsby.

## Headers

Each of the 6 different headers are below.

```
# H1  - I am a Header
## H2 - I am a Header
### H3 - I am a Header
#### H4 - I am a Header
##### H5 - I am a Header
###### H6 - I am a Header
```

# H1 - I am a Header

## H2 - I am a Header

### H3 - I am a Header

#### H4 - I am a Header

##### H5 - I am a Header

###### H6 - I am a Header

## Emphasis

The modern way to add emphasis to words and phrases.

```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks*.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and *single asteriks***.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

These are the different types of lists.

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
    - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
    1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links

This is how to create links.

```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")


[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../Article_1)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> but not
example.com.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later (see above).

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## Images

Adding images is not very difficult.

```
Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style:
![Gatsby Theme Naked Logo ](../../images/naked-logo.png "Gatsby Theme Naked Logo")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: ../../images/naked-logo.png "Gatsby Theme Naked Logo" "Gatsby Theme Naked Logo"
```

Inline-style:

## Code and Syntax highlighting (with PrismJS)

Using PrismJS with Gatsby affords you the ability to share and highlght code snippets.

```
Inline code has only `one tick` around it.
```

Example of Inline Code:

Inline code has only `one tick` around it.

````
Blocks of code have three backticks around it. ``` CODE ```. After the first tick add the language of choice. Look at these examples below:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting"

```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"

```

## Tables

You can add tables to your blog posts like this.

```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

Add a Blockquote using the following syntax. IN

``` markdown
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
```

> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

You could use raw HTML in your Markdown. But since this is Mdx you shouldn't need to. Now you can just simply create components and import theme.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

## Horizontal rule

```markdown
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## Line breaks 

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit **Enter** once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

## Summary

As you can see using Markdown with PrismJs in a Gatsby application and Mdx gives you everything you could possibly need to correctly write your posts in Markdown.
